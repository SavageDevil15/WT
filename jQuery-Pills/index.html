                        <p>Software project development comes under the category of project based learning (PBL).
                            PBL is an instructional approach designed to give students the opportunity to develop knowledge
                            and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the
                            real world by using domain specific language technologies.
                            PBL is "learning by doing."
                            Modern world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects.
                            In short, if students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based
                            world. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning.
                            Project based learning will also redefine the role of teacher as mentor in the learning process.
                            The PBL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to
                            research and respond to and/or solve.
                            It brings students not only to know, understand and remember rather it takes them to analyze,
                            design and apply categories of Bloom’s Taxonomy.</p><br>

                        <p>Project Centric Learning (PCL) is a powerful tool for students to work in areas of their choice and strengths. Along with course based projects, curriculum can be enriched with semester long Engineering Design and Development courses, in which students can solve socially relevant problems using various technologies from relevant disciplines. The various socially relevant domains can be like Health care, Agriculture, Defense, Education, Smart City, Smart Energy and Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan. To gain the necessary skills to tackle such projects, students can select relevant online courses and acquire skills from numerous sources under guidance of faculty and enrich their knowledge in the project domain, thereby achieving project centric learning. Modern world sustained and advanced through the successful completion of projects. In short, if students are prepared for success in life, we need to prepare them for a project-based world. It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning. Project based learning will also redefine the role of teacher as mentor in the learning process. The PCL model focuses the student on a big open-ended question, challenge, or problem to research and respond to and/or solve.
